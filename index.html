<p><span class="drop-cap"><i>W</i></span>hen Ruth, the Moabite widow who had returned to Bethlehem in Israel with her mother-in-law from Moab came back from the execution of the scheme she and her mother-in-law Naomi had planned and had finished narrating how the events went, her mother-in-law encouraged her saying; <i>“Sit back and relax, my daughter, until we find out how things turn out; this man isn’t going to waste any time. Mark my words, he’s going to get everything wrapped up today”</i> (Ruth 3:18 MSG). There is a comment in my Bible beside this verse that reads; “If Boaz a human being won’t rest until he has settled a matter that would make Ruth happy, would God rest while we his children aren’t yet happy?” Today however, we aren’t discussing God’s unfailing ability to make available the provisions He has promised us, rather it is to draw our attention to something equally, if not more, important.</p>

<p>Our God is a faithful God; when He speaks, He does what He says He will do. God will not speak until it is what His power can accomplish. His word is His bond. The scriptures say this of Him; <i>“For You have magnified Your word above all Your name” </i>(Psalm 138:2 NKJV). God will rather let His name be dragged into the mud than let one word of His fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Let us look at God’s antecedents in keeping His word, just a few cases as they are too many to even mention them all:</p>
<ol>
<li>He had said He will destroy (wipe) the human race He had created from the face of the earth along with every living thing (Genesis 6:7). It took several years (120 years according to Biblical scholars) but He did it (Genesis 7:1-24). He said it, He did it.
</li>

<li>God called Abraham from his father’s house to go to a land he will be shown with a promise to make him into a great nation (Genesis 12:1-2). Abraham remained childless for many years, but eventually the son he was promised (Genesis 17:19, 18:10) arrived (Genesis 21:1-2).
</li>

<li>God promised He will send a savior that will save mankind from the power and consequence of sin (Isaiah 7:14, 9:6). He did exactly that (Matthew 1:18-23).
</li>

<li>Jesus said He will die and be buried but after three days He will rise again (Matthew 17:22-23, Mark 9:30-32). He was crucified, He died, He was buried, He rose (Luke 24:1-7).</li>

<li>The Father promised the gift of the Holy Spirit through the Prophet Joel (Joel 2:28-29), this promise was repeated by Jesus Christ when He said <i>“But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper (Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor-Counselor, Strengthener, Standby) will not come to you; but if I go, <b>I will send Him (the Holy Spirit) to you</b> [to be in close fellowship with you]</i> (John 16:7 AMP, emphasis added), that Spirit came on the apostles on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4) and has continued to fill believers till now.
</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s a song that any time I listen to, I am reminded of the certainty of Christ’s return. The chorus goes like this:</p>
<blockquote cite="#">“You lived, You died, You said in three days You would rise, You did, You’re alive. You rule, You reign, You said You’re coming back gain. I know You will, all the earth will sing Your praises. All the earth will sing Your Praises.” (<i>All the Earth will sing your praises</i>; from <i><b>Offering of Worship</b></i> album (2003) by Paul Baloche).</blockquote>

<p>Our God has maintained a track record of saying it and doing it. Therefore, if the Lord Jesus Christ has promised His return, then He will. He told the disciples and is now telling us; <i>“… I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, <b>I will come again</b> and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also”</i> (John 14:2b-3 NKJV, emphasis added). Not only did Jesus promise to return, on the day of His ascension, two angels had this to say; <i>“… This [same] Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, <b>will return in just the same way</b> as you have watched Him go into heaven”</i> (Acts 1:11 AMP). He promised His return, angels echoed it! He’s coming back.</p>

<p>Friend, it’s been thousands of years since He promised His return, but judging from His antecedents, He is still coming. Are you ready? Now is the time to get the affairs of your life in order; His return will soon be upon us.</p>

<p>Don’t just get ready, <b><i>live ready!</i></b></p>
